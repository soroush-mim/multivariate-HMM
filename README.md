# multivariate-HMM
Hidden Markov Models are powerful statistical models used for sequential data analysis. A multivariate hidden Markov model extends the traditional HMM to handle multiple observations at each state.in this repo i have implemented several functions and algorithms in HMM for multivariate case such as alpha recursion, beta recursion, pair marginals, expectation maximization and viterbi.

more details can be fine in the notebook, i recommend to open the notebook in google colab.

report is in persian.
